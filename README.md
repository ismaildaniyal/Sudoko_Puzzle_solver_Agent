# Sudoku Puzzle Solver Agent

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent agent that solves Sudoku puzzles using various AI techniques. The solution is provided in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow along with the implementation and understand the underlying logic.

## Features
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Implements a classic backtracking approach to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- **Constraint Propagation**: Uses constraint satisfaction techniques to reduce the search space.
- **Heuristics**: Incorporates heuristics to optimize the solving process.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representation of the solving process for better understanding.
